# SLMT's Solution to Advent of Code

Here are my solution to Advent of Code 2020 written in Rust.

## How to Run?

I put a few test cases in the code, so you can run the test cases with the following command:

```bash
> cargo test
```

If you want to run a solution for a particular puzzle, please put your input into a file named `input.txt` and use this:

```bash
> cargo run --bin [NAME OF BINARY] < input.txt
```

Check the name of the binaries for all the puzzles below:

| Day | Name | Part | Binary Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Report Repair | 1 | `day1_part1` |
| 1 | Report Repair | 2 | `day1_part2` |
