# SLMT's Solution to Advent of Code

Here are my solutions written in Rust for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

## How to Run?

I put a few test cases in the code, so you can run the test cases with the following command:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

To run a solution for a particular puzzle, put your input into a file named `input.txt` and use this:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin [NAME OF BINARY] < input.txt
```

Check below for the names of the binaries for all the puzzles:

| Day | Name | Part 1 Solution Binary | Part 2 Solution Binary |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Report Repair | `day1_part1` ([Code](src/bin/day1_part1.rs)) | `day1_part2` ([Code](src/bin/day1_part2.rs))  |
| 2 | Password Philosophy | `day2_part1` ([Code](src/bin/day2_part1.rs)) | `day2_part2` ([Code](src/bin/day2_part2.rs))  |
